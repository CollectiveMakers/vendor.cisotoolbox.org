# Vendor (TPRM) — Third-Party Risk Management

> Part of [CISO Toolbox](https://www.cisotoolbox.org) — open-source security tools for CISOs.

## Features

### Registry and risk scoring
- Vendor registry with **6-axis classification** (operational impact, process dependency, replacement difficulty, data sensitivity, system integration, regulatory exposure)
- Threat level calculation `(Dependence × Penetration) / (Maturity × Trust)` aligned with EBIOS RM methodology
- Automatic **tier** derivation (critical / high / medium / low) and **DORA critical ICT provider** detection
- 5×5 inherent and residual risk matrix with a timeline slider

### Templates and assessments
- **Modèles d'évaluation** — customizable templates for questionnaires (vendor-filled) or audits (internally-filled). Default templates created on first visit, including the **42 ANSSI hygiene rules** as a ready-to-use audit template.
- Template editor: sections, free-text questions, criticality (info / major / blocker), weight (0–100)
- **Import templates from Excel** (downloadable `.xlsx` example with data validation) or create them in the graphical editor
- Template-driven assessments with **coverage status** (`Covered` / `Partial` / `Not covered` / `N/A`), mandatory **corrective actions or justification** on partial / not-covered, per-question progress, submit-for-approval workflow
- **Weighted maturity score** aggregating multiple approved assessments (per-question criticality, per-kind weight, temporal decay, manual overrides)

### Vendor Portal (companion app at `/portal/`)
- Standalone single-page app for vendors to fill questionnaires in their own browser
- **Direct link sharing** via gzipped + AES-256 encrypted URL hash (small questionnaires)
- File-based sharing (`.json`, `.ctenc`, `.xlsx`) with a ready-to-send HTML email template
- Overdue due-date badge, per-question live status, autosave in `localStorage`
- Vendor re-exports the filled response (encrypted JSON or Excel) and emails it back; you re-import it into the matching assessment

### Data and history
- Document registry with expiry alerts, URL verification, confidence scoring
- **Undo / redo** (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) and **snapshots** panel with optional AES-256 encryption
- AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 (250k iterations) for encrypted files and snapshots
- Bilingual FR / EN with lazy-loaded English translations

### AI assistant (optional)
- Suggest vendor-specific risks and mitigating measures (Anthropic Claude or OpenAI GPT)
- AI collection of public vendor documentation with URL verification
- Answer suggestion for questionnaires

## Quick start

1. Visit [vendor.cisotoolbox.org](https://vendor.cisotoolbox.org) or clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Load `demo-en.json` from **File → Open** to explore a complete vendor assessment (MedSecure)
4. No backend, no account required

## Vendor Portal

The portal is a separate standalone page under `portal/`, served at [vendor.cisotoolbox.org/portal/](https://vendor.cisotoolbox.org/portal/).

- **Vendor workflow**: click the link you received, enter the password shared out of band, fill the questionnaire, export the response. Data stays in the browser at every step.
- **Your workflow (issuer)**: open an assessment, click **Copier modèle email** or **Lien direct**, send the vendor the link + password through separate channels, then import the returned file.

## Architecture

- 100% client-side vanilla JS — no framework, no build step, no `node_modules`
- Data in the browser (localStorage autosave + downloadable JSON/Excel for persistence)
- Event delegation via `data-click` / `data-change` / `data-input` (CSP-compliant, no inline handlers)
- AES-256-GCM encryption for saved files and snapshots
- Shared libraries from `../../shared/` copied at deploy time: `cisotoolbox.js`, `cisotoolbox_local.js`, `i18n.js`, `ai_common.js`, `ct_refselect.js`, `cisotoolbox.css`
- Reuses the shared **SVG icon helper** (`_icon(name)` from `cisotoolbox.js`), the shared **snapshots panel** (`_renderSnapshotsPanel()` from `cisotoolbox_local.js`) and the shared **undo hook** (`_installUndoHook()`)
- `<body class="ct-app-shell">` enables the fixed toolbar + sidebar + internal-scroll layout; the portal omits that class for natural document scroll
